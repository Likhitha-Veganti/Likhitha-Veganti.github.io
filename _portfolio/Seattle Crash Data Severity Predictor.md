title: "Seattle Crash Data Severity Predictor"
excerpt: "Seattle implemented a Vision Zero initiative in 2015 with the goal of eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries on city streets by 2030. However, in the past two years, deaths and serious injuries from traffic collisions have been on the rise, indicating that current initiatives may not be enough. The project aims to use Seattle's collision dataset to analyze different factors that could inform street redesigns or alternative modes of transit programs.<br/>"
