<h2> Introduction: </h2>
<p align="justify">
I am currently pursuing my master's degree at Seattle University, I often find it challenging to navigate the campus and locate essential amenities such as cafes and bicycle parking. To address this issue, I decided to make a comprehensive map of Seattle University. This map is designed to assist students, faculty, and visitors in effortlessly navigating the campus, providing a quick and efficient way to locate key areas. The primary focus of this project is to facilitate easy identification of cafes and bicycle parking spaces within the university, enhancing the overall experience for those exploring the campus.

  function resizeIframe() {
    const iframe = document.getElementById('seattleU-iframe');
    const contentWindow = iframe.contentWindow || iframe.contentDocument.defaultView;
    if (contentWindow) {
      const contentHeight = contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight;
      iframe.style.height = contentHeight + 'px';
    }
  }
  // Call the resizeIframe function when the page is loaded and when the content changes
  window.onload = resizeIframe;
  window.addEventListener('message', resizeIframe);

<h2>About Dataset:</h2>
<p align="justify">
The dataset utilized in this project is derived from the Seattle University area. In order to collect information about the university's attributes, the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database was employed. The code makes use of the OSM Python library, particularly the OSMnx package, to extract geospatial data pertaining to parks, buildings, cafes, and cycle parking within the specified boundaries of Seattle University. Parks are identified through the "park" tag, buildings are captured using the "building" tag, cafes are singled out with the "amenity" tag and the value "cafe," and cycle parking locations are extracted through the "amenity" tag with the value "bicycle_parking." The resultant dataset provides a comprehensive overview of these features within Seattle University, furnishing valuable insights into the distribution of parks, buildings, cafes, and cycle parking areas throughout the university campus.

<h2>Effectiveness of the graph</h2>
<ul>
  <li></li>Geographic Visualization: The map provides a visual representation of the locations of food chain restaurants on a geographical map. This makes it easy to see where these restaurants are concentrated and their distribution across a specific area.</li>

  <li>Marker Clustering: By using marker clustering, you can avoid clutter on the map when there are many data points (restaurant locations). This feature groups nearby markers into clusters, which can help you quickly identify areas with a high density of food chain restaurants.</li>

  <li>Tooltip Information: You've added tooltips to the markers, which display the name of each restaurant when you hover over a marker. This allows you to access additional information about each restaurant without cluttering the map with labels, making it easy to identify individual restaurants.</li>

<li>Custom Icons: You've used custom icons for the markers, which can visually distinguish food chain restaurants from other map markers, making it clear which locations are of interest.</li>

<li>Zoom and Pan: The map allows users to zoom in and pan around to explore specific areas of interest in more detail, which can be useful for analyzing the density and distribution of restaurants at different levels of granularity.</li>
</ul>
