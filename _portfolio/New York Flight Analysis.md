title: "New York Flight Analysis"
excerpt: "
The analysis will attempt to identify the core cause of departure delays for United Airlines aircraft departing from New York City in 2013. The goal is to decrease flight delay time by determining what variables are causing the delays.This will enable United Airlines customers to improve those aspects, hence increasing customer happiness and flying effectively. The study focuses on environmental characteristics such as the time of day, year, temperature, wind speed, precipitation and visibility.
Our analysis will be carried out by leveraging the nycflights13 dataset. This dataset contains the departure timings for all flights departing from New York Cityâ€™s three airports - La Guardia (LGA), John F. Kennedy (JFK), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in 2013. For the scope of this project, we will be focusing on the data related to United Airlines.
