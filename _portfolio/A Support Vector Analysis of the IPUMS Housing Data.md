### Introduction
The project focuses on SVMs to classify homes as owned or rented based on various individual and housing variables. This novel application of SVM in the real estate domain aims to provide insights into factors influencing homeownership.

### Dataset Description
The data, sourced from the United States Census Bureau, includes variables like number of rooms, income, age, marital status, and homeownership status. With 23 variables and 75,388 observations, it provides a comprehensive view of housing patterns in the U.S.

### Methodology
The methodology encompasses data cleaning and preprocessing, including feature selection and scaling. The SVM models are implemented using linear, radial, and polynomial kernels, each evaluated for performance.

### Discussions
The project discusses the implications of SVM in real estate, highlighting the potential of machine learning in policy-making. Key predictors of homeownership, such as age, household size, and economic factors, are identified and analyzed for their impact.

### Conclusions
The study concludes with the effectiveness of SVM in predicting homeownership. It underscores the importance of certain demographic and socio-economic factors in homeownership and suggests how these insights can aid policymakers and real estate professionals.

This summary encapsulates the essence of each section while providing a cohesive understanding of the project's scope, methodology, and findings.
