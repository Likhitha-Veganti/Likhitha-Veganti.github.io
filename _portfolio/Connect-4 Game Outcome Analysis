# Introduction
Connect-4 is a two-player board game with a simple objective: connect four discs of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal. This project investigates the Connect-4 game dataset, comprising legal game positions where victory is not yet achieved, and the next move is not forced.
### Goals
- Examine the effectiveness of various analytical techniques.
- Utilize supervised algorithms for outcome prediction.
- Employ unsupervised learning for pattern discovery.

# Theoretical Background
A detailed discussion of each algorithm's theory and application is provided in the report, encompassing topics like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks, PCA, SVD, and Clustering.

# Methodology
The project includes data visualization, preprocessing with one-hot encoding, training various models, and evaluating them based on accuracy, silhouette score, and completeness score. 

# Results and Discussions
