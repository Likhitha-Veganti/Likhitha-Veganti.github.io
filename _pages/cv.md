Data Scientist with 4 years of experience in building and deploying ML models and data engineering/ETL pipelines with various tools and technologies, including Python, SQL, and cloud platforms. Proficient in implementing data-driven solutions to real-world business problems using Statistical analysis, Data visualization, and Data management.

## EXPERIENCE

### Gearsim – Data Science Intern
July 2023 – September 2023

- Developed a Flask-based app for generating data profiling reports by uploading CSV files, reducing report generation time by 80%.
- Conducted hypothesis testing on United Airlines' Flight Delay dataset, resulting in a 15% reduction in flight delay prediction error.
- Created a predictive model for landing gear force on airplane legs during landings, achieving an R-squared value of 0.85.
- Developed a Streamlit-based frontend application for real-time predictions, improving operational efficiency by 20%.

### Syniti – Senior Data Consultant
January 2020 – August 2022

- Developed an automated SQL Query Generator using Python, eliminating the dependency on the BI team for data analyses/reporting requirements, saving at least 1.25 BI headcount per year.
- Implemented a real-time support ticket routing system using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, reducing response time by 95% (from 20 to 1 min/ticket) with 98% accuracy of ticket classification based on severity.
- Owned and led new hire technical training and demo project mentoring. Trained 40+ new hires in a span of six months.

### Wipro – Data Engineer
July 2018 – January 2020

- Led the data migration from Mainframe to HANA by creating structured de-normalized ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) datasets, reducing manual effort by 93% (from 12 to 1 HC/year).
- Automated data cleaning, validation, and data quality checks during data migration using Regex, Dedup, and Pandas, decreasing the processing time by 97% (from 100 to 4 hrs) for each data migration cycle, consisting of at least 1B+ data records.
- Developed executive-level project status Tableau dashboards for milestone status, blockers/risks, and call to action focus areas.

### Grozip - Intern
December 2016 – January 2017

- Designed and launched a chatbot on the Facebook Messenger platform for real-time customer support and product search functionality, improving referral traffic by 54%.
- Led the redesign of data lake architecture for a new web application during migration, using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram resulting in efficient data retrieval and reduced deduplication by 75%.
- Designed a targeted campaign framework, using Google Analytics, to identify focus regions based on website traffic and user behavior for sales and marketing teams, increasing revenue-per-sale by 60%.

## PROJECTS

### Seattle Crash Data Severity Predictor
[Link to Project](Project_link)

- Developed a Crash Severity Predictor using Random Forest and Logistic Regression (Lasso) models using location, vehicle density, light, weather, and road conditions as features.
- Improved the accuracy of the model to 98% from 76% by (1) imputing 10% missing data using FancyImputer, KNN Imputer and (2) K-cross validation and hyperparameter tuning.

### Predicting Use of Harmful Substances Based on Parental Involvement, Religious Beliefs, and Education
[Link to Project](Project_link)

- Conducted an analysis to determine alcohol, marijuana, or tobacco and at what age individuals are likely to start using them based on parental involvement, religious belief, and education.
- Results from the analysis: youth’s feelings about attending school, parental communication about substance use, the child’s accomplishments had an impact on the decision to consume these substances.
- Used Data Imputation (MICE), Stratified Sampling, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods, Hyperparameter Tuning.

### Image Caption Predictor
[Link to Project](Project_link)

- Built a model to generate the caption using Flicker8k dataset. Application is developed for individuals with visual impairments.
- Dual Input for Neural Network: (1) Extracted image features using transfer learning (VGG 16) and (2) An embedding layer with LSTM to capture the long-term context of words within the captions.
- The model performed well to generate the caption with BLEU score of 0.6.
