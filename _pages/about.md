Welcome! I am a data scientist with 4 years of experience in building and deploying ML models and data engineering/ETL pipelines using various tools and technologies such as Python, SQL, and cloud platforms. Prior to pursuing my Master's Degree at Seattle University, I worked as a Data Consultant at Syniti and a Data Engineer at Wipro Technologies in India. My expertise lies in implementing data-driven solutions to real-world business problems using statistical analysis, data visualization, and data management techniques.
